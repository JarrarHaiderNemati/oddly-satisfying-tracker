Welcome to my first full-stack project! This website lets users sign up, share their moments, and edit them whenever they want. It’s designed to make capturing and managing memories fun and easy.

The website is built using HTML, CSS, and Node.js. To run it locally, clone the repository, install dependencies using `npm install`, and start the server with `npm start`. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`.

Some of the features include user sign-up and login, creating and editing moments.

Future plans include adding more features, refining user profiles, and options to like or comment on moments. I’m excited to keep improving this project and learning more along the way.

Thank you for checking out my project. Feel free to share feedback or ideas.
